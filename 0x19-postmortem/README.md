🛑 End Time: November 15, 2023, 05:30 PM (UTC)
Impact:
🔐 The authentication service went on a coffee break, denying access to accounts for 30% of users. It was like a virtual lockout, minus the picket signs.
Root Cause:
🕵️‍♂️ Sherlock's sleuthing revealed a misconfiguration in our authentication service's code – a classic case of mistaken identity.

Timeline:
Detection Time:
🚨 November 15, 2023, 03:45 PM (UTC)
Detection Method:
👀 Monitoring alerts raised the alarm, like a digital smoke signal.
Actions Taken:
🕵️‍♀️ Investigated logs like detectives on the hunt.
🕵️‍♂️ Assumed an external API went on vacation and checked if it sent a postcard.
🚀 Misleadingly explored recent code deployments for bugs, thinking, "Who let the bugs out?"
Misleading Paths:
🌐 Initially thought it was a network hiccup, but it was just the service playing hide and seek.
🕵️‍♂️ Investigated unrelated code changes – turns out, the code was on a coffee break too.
Escalation:
📣 Called in the DevOps and Security teams for a tech Avengers assemble moment.
Resolution:
🔍 Identified the rogue code culprit.
🔄 Rolled back the deployment, a technological "Ctrl + Z."
🧰 Applied a hotfix – turns out, duct tape works in the digital realm too.
🎉 Monitored service recovery, and it rose from the ashes like a phoenix in a server room.

Root Cause and Resolution:
Root Cause:
🔍 The authentication service got a makeover it didn't sign up for, thanks to a mischievous code change during deployment. It was like a digital identity crisis.
Resolution:
🚑 The issue was fixed by taking the service back to its last known stable version, like sending it to a spa for a rollback massage. A hotfix was applied – a digital Band-Aid – to restore proper token validation and bring the service back from its code-induced trance.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:
Improvements/Fixes:
🛠️ Enhanced deployment pipelines – because even code needs a smooth catwalk.
🤖 Implemented stricter code review processes – no more rogue code sneaking into the party.
🚨 Increased real-time monitoring – catching issues faster than a superhero responding to a distress signal.
Tasks:
🛠️ Conducted a comprehensive review of deployment processes – because even code needs a spa day.
📋 Established a checklist for code changes – a digital compass to avoid unintended detours.
📡 Enhanced monitoring and alerting systems – making sure our code is always on its best behavior.
🚀 Scheduled a team-wide training session – because even superheroes need a tune-up.
